        <h2>Welcome to CrediSafe, your secure destination for managing personal credentials. This static website allows users to register and login safely, ensuring that sensitive information is handled with care. Designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, CrediSafe provides a seamless user experience, demonstrating the core concepts of web authentication and user management. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases a modern approach to interactive web design while keeping user security at the forefront. As my first web development project, I learned a lot about structuring a website, styling with CSS, adding interactivity with JavaScript, and understanding the importance of user experience and security. This project reflects my initial journey into web development and my excitement for building functional and user-friendly websites.</h2>
