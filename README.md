# Static Website Project
Simple HTML/CSS/JS project with landing, login, and register pages.
HomePage: 
Landing page with site info and links to Register and Login. Styled header, buttons, and centered text.

Registration Page: 
Form for name, email, and password. JS checks password match, saves credentials locally, redirects to Login. Form styled with centered layout, shadows, and hover effects.

Login Page: 
Form for email and password. JS validates credentials, shows errors if invalid, redirects to Dashboard on success. Shares same styling as registration form.

Dashboard Page: 
Displays centered “Thank you!” message with subtle glowing effect. Background matches site theme.

CSS: 
Consistent colors, fonts, form styles, buttons, and animations for glow and hover effects.

JS:
 Handles form validation, credential storage, error messages, and page redirections using jQuery.

Flow: 
Home → Register → Login → Dashboard, providing a simple secure credential demonstration.
